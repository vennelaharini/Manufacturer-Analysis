ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Power BI Journey! ðŸŒŸ

I recently completed the ATNA "Dashboard in a Day" Online Workshop, where I learned to build dynamic Power BI reports and dashboards from scratch. This comprehensive experience deepened my understanding of data modeling, visualization, and storytelling techniques with Power BI.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights from the Workshop:
âœ… Built a Power BI data model and explored relationships.
âœ… Created impactful visualizations, grouped and binned data, and added custom date tables.
âœ… Added hierarchies, matrix visualizations, and DAX measures to extract meaningful insights.
âœ… Designed and published full Power BI reports with conditional formatting, logos, custom visuals, and bookmarks.
âœ… Created mobile-friendly views, published reports, built dashboards, and explored storytelling with Power BI in PowerPoint.

This hands-on experience has been a fantastic step in my journey toward becoming a proficient data visualization and analytics professional.

ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps: Continue to refine my skills and apply them to real-world projects to deliver meaningful insights.
